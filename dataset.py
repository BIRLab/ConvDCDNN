    There are two types of BCI datasets:

    1. P300 Stimulus Dataset
        The shapes of the dataset tensors are as follows.
            responses: (batch, channel, sample)
            labels: (batch,)
        The classes are as follows.
            0: P300 signal
            1: non P300 signal

    2. Character Dataset
        The shapes of the dataset tensors are as follows.
            responses: (batch, row_column, epoch, channel, sample)
            labels: (batch,)
        The classes are as follows.
            0-25: A-Z
            26-34: 1-9

    The P300 Stimulus Dataset is used to train the stimulus classifier,
    while the Character Dataset is used to evaluate the final character
    classification results.
